# hairpinbend_collision_avoidance_yolov8
This project aims to prevent vehicle collisions at dangerous hairpin bends by detecting trucks in real-time using YOLOv8 object detection models. The system gives priority to heavy vehicles by controlling traffic lights intelligently through an ESP32 microcontroller, ensuring safe, automated traffic flow without manual supervision.
